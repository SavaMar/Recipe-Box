== Week 3 of mackenziechild 12 in 12 Challenge

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
My goal with this challenge is to teach myself Ruby on Rails with mackenziechild by building a new web app (using rails)

Things you may want to cover:
This week I built a recipe box, with nested forms (each recipe has multiple ingredients and multiple steps), image uploading, and using HAML instead of ERB.
